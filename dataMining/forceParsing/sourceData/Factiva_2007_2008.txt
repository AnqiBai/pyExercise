NEW YORK, Aug. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- S&P MidCap 400 constituent  Leucadia National Corp. (NYSE: LUK) will replace  KeySpan Corp. (NYSE: KSE) in the S&P 500, and  Life Time Fitness Inc. (NYSE: LTM) will replace Leucadia in the S&P MidCap 400, after the close of trading on Friday, August 24. Keyspan is being acquired by S&P Global 1200 constituent  National Grid plc (NYSE: NGG) in a deal expected to close on or about that date, pending final approvals.   

Standard and Poor's also announces today a clarification of its definition of a U.S. company. A U.S. company, for index purposes, should have the following characteristics:   

    -- Incorporated in the U.S.
    -- Financial reporting should be U.S. GAAP, in U.S. dollars, and the
       company should not be considered a foreign entity by the SEC
    -- A corporate governance structure consistent with U.S. practice
    -- Headquartered in the U.S.
    -- The U.S. portion of revenues, operations, fixed assets and employees
       should be a significant portion of the total, but need not exceed 50%
    -- The common stock should be listed on NYSE, Amex, NASDAQ or NYSE Arca
       (ADRs are not acceptable)
    -- The company should generally be considered a U.S. company by analysts
       and investors
   

If one of these criteria is not met and there is no other major market in which a company would logically be assigned, S&P may deem it a U.S. company for index purposes.   

Leucadia National engages in manufacturing, real estate, medical product development, and winery operations. Headquartered in New York, NY, the company will be added to the S&P 500 GICS (Global Industry Classification Standard) Multi-Sector Holdings Sub-Industry index.   

Life Time Fitness designs, builds, and operates sports and athletic, fitness, family recreation, and resort/spa centers. Headquartered in Eden Prairie, MN, the company will be added to the S&P MidCap 400 GICS Leisure Facilities Sub-Industry index.   



    Following is a summary of the changes:

                         S&P 500 INDEX -- August 24, 2007

                  COMPANY        GICS ECONOMIC SECTOR    GICS SUB-INDUSTRY
      ADDED   Leucadia National        Financials       Multi-Sector Holdings
     DELETED      Keyspan              Utilities          Multi-Utilities


                      S&P MIDCAP 400 INDEX - August 24, 2007

                   COMPANY        GICS ECONOMIC SECTOR     GICS SUB-INDUSTRY
      ADDED   Life Time Fitness  Consumer Discretionary    Leisure Facilities
     DELETED  Leucadia National        Financials        Multi-Sector Holdings
